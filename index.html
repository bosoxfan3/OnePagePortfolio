        <p>
          I love coding because there is absolutely nothing like the euphoria of watching
          thousands of lines of code turn into a full-fledged, highly-functioning app.
          I'm especially drawn to the more puzzle-like aspects of coding, such as 
          algorithm scripting and creating and combining React components.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exercising with my dog, listening to the
          Pardon My Take podcast, or watching Australian Rules football.

          <p>
            Pick 16 is a re-creation of the traditional NFL pick'em game. It was created after
            years of running a pick'em league among friends receiving entries via email and scoring 
            by hand. This app allows anyone to select winners for NFL games weekly and track their record
            against other users. It's a simple, low time commitment way to show off NFL knowledge.

          <p>
            RestFull was created to help people become more self-aware about their sleep habits. 
            By charting how external factors such as caffeine and blue light exposure from devices 
            affects your mood, RestFull makes it easy for users to extrapolate potential lifestyle 
            changes that could improve their sleep and overall well-being.

            This app has 2 dual purposes: To allow users to get up-to-the-minute updates on the 
            schedules of BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains, and to allow users to simultaneously 
            access entertainment options within the app so they can keep an eye on train arrivals 
            and departures.
